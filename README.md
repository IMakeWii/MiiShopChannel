<h1>Mii Shop Channel</h1>
The Wii channel that allows you to install WADs, and doesn't leak your data, unlike Rii Shop Channel.

This repository is used for both source code, and WADs, for convenience.

<h1>To whoever leaked everyone's data with the Rii Shop Channel</h1>
Whoever you are, you destroyed something that everyone was hopeful for. Thanks, butthole.
I wanted to use Rii Shop Channel myself, but at that time, I didn't have my Wii modded.

I'm <b>glad</b> that I didn't get to actually installing it.
